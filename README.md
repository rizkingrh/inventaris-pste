# Inventory System üì¶

## üìã Project Overview
This project is a inventory management system designed specifically for electrical engineering department laboratories. The system aims to streamline the tracking of laboratory equipment, components, and supplies while providing an intuitive interface for staff and students. Built with modern web technologies, this application offers a robust solution for managing laboratory assets, tracking usage, and maintaining supplier information.

This project was created as part of a college database design course to address the real-world need for efficient inventory management in electrical engineering laboratories. Traditional paper-based inventory methods or generic inventory systems often fail to address the unique requirements of electrical engineering labs, such as tracking specialized components, managing equipment calibration schedules, and monitoring the usage of consumable supplies. This system was built to fill that gap and provide a tailored solution that improves operational efficiency, reduces equipment downtime, and helps maintain adequate stock levels of critical components.
